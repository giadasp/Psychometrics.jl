# Psychometrics.jl

*A Julia package for psychometric data analysis.*

## Package Features

This package is a playground I built for working on my research projects. It provides objects (Julia structs) and dedicated methods (functions) to deal with psychometric data under the item response theory (IRT) statistical paradigm.

The documentation is still in progress. Nevertheless, some functions have detailed descriptions that can be found in the documentation pages or using the Julia help ?.

The [Tutorial](@ref) provides a tutorial explaining how to get started using Psychometrics.

See the [Index](@ref main-index) for the complete list of documented functions and types.
